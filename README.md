# Life Perspective

# Ramblings below and, hopefully, clean text above

If it's okay with you, I'm going to ramble for a bit. It's all can do at the
moment. But since this is currently the only way I know how to write, I have
write like this if I want to get words onto the page. This definitely did not
need an explanation.

## Logical

First up, we all work from a logical basis, even when most things about
ourselves seems the opposite. There is a reason to everything. And self
contradiction is actually normal for most people. I think we can all agree that
self contradiction is not a necessarily a good thing, though it's not
necessarily bad either. It's bad in that self contradiction makes you
unpredictable and irrational. For example, people may not always do as they
preach. There may be multiple reasons, but let's assume they are in a position
to easily do what they preach. Self contradiction is good only when you realize
it. It's often one of the biggest opportunities for you grow. Once you realize
something is wrong with the way you think, you fix it and move on. The way I
said it seems simple, but in reality, fixing it may take a long time.

People are logical in that they often believe that what they're doing will help
them reach their goals. The keyword here is believe, because that belief can be
false. It reminds me of Curry's paradox which I plan to discuss later. Anyways,
people's beliefs are real but not all beliefs are true. One common belief is
that hard work will always lead to success in the end. We can immediately shut
that down by listing any number of examples. When we're working we often aren't
completely aware of our beliefs they lie in our subconcious. Being completely
aware of your beliefs is to your benefit. In order to convince other people that
what you're doing will reach your goals, it's a good idea to cross check
beliefs. It'll be weird otherwise.

## Information Assymmetry

Let's be real. There will always be something I don't know about you and
something you don't know about me. Everyday life is an imperfect information
game. No one knows everything. Conflict arises when one party assumes the other
party knows something but they actually don't. Say you're scheduling a meeting
with someone and for some odd reason, the other party had to cancel. You walk
into meeting and find no one. Frustated, you pull out your phone to give the
other party a piece of your mind. Looks like you have a new message. The message
says that the other party couldn't make it to the meeting and it was sent the
day before. Should you still be frustrated? Well, at the very least, you became
frustrated at one point. You were frustrated, because you believed the other
party will make it to the meeting. Actually, you believed with so much certainty
that you became frustrated over it.

Interactions would be more peaceful if we spent a little more time figuring out
what we know and don't know about each other. Of course, it probably won't solve
your roommate not doing the dishes. On bright side, now you know your roommate
is intentionally not doing the dishes, because you both established the fact
that your roommate knew there were dishes to be done in the sink. An
intervention may fix that problem.

## Goals

Everyone wants to reach their goals. But sometimes, we don't set the right
intermediary goals to reach our ultimate goals. Rather, I'm pretty sure it is an
everyday occurence that we don't set the right goals to reach the next
ones. Well, it's just plain difficult to set them in the first place. And the
time to make a comprehensive plan would be better used towards the goals you
already made.

## Stress Testing

Stress testing is important in work and also in life. I will be focusing on
applying stress testing to your life. Life has many limitations and going over
the limit may cause problems. For example, remember the time when you ran too
hard and ran out of breath. Or that time when you went over the speed limit and
got ticketed. Going over a limit can be bad, but it can also be good. An obvious
case is overperforming at a competition. The real question I want to answer to
how to figure out when to go over our limits to reap the rewards and avoid the
penalties. My answer is stress testing. To be more precise, it's regular stress
testing. Once a month, once a week, and even daily. Strength training is a prime
example of stress testing. Load up too much weight and you're prone to
injury. Too little and you're not making much in gains. If you hit the sweet
spot right before your limits, you can maximize gains. Just to clarify, limits
is not a clear cut line; it's a range of trade offs of potential gains and risk
of injury. So asking the question is it worth the risk is essential when testing
yourself.

People tend to get weaker past a certain age. I'm not sure why, but it's what
the data says. It may not be the case that you can do something that you could
easily do 20 years ago. It doesn't even have to be physical. During school, you
probably knew a lot more about the subjects at school than you do now. We
forget, we deteriorate. Now the problem happens is when we assume we can do
something just because we have done it before. If you manage to do it, great
nothing to worry about. If you fail to do it, you would be lucky just to get
away with failure. There is usually a fairly large penalty associated with
failing to do something beyond yourself. If you used to be able to do backflips,
you do one because thought it would work but fail, you could be in a whole lot
of trouble. I recommend stress testing once again. Even if you're sure you can
do it, set up your environment so that even if you fail, nothing besides failure
will happen. That means trying to backflip on padded surface before going to
concrete.

Another area where stress testing is useful is reproducability. How often can
you reproduce an outcome? Nine out of ten times? One out of ten? Make sure you
have a sense of the success rate vs the size and frequency of the risks. In my
opinion, it's perfectly fine to play a game with a low success rate over and
over if the cost of failure is trivial each game. Of course, the cumulative
costs will add up, but if you feel like the success, if you finally reach it
that is, is worth it, then the costs are justified.

## Learning

I'm a firm believer that anything can be learned, and I mean anything. Throw
natural talent out the window. Though to be fair, there are physical
limitations. In our scenario, we'll assume any pair of people have the same
physical limitations. Is this fair? Probably not. Well, I guess I need to work
on the innate talent doesn't matter argument. Let's say with the advances in
technology, the gaps in our physical differences matter less and less. Even if
you're missing an arm or leg, we now have prosthetics that have the potential to
be even better the original. Though, I doubt that can go on forever. I'm still
waiting for technology that modifies us at the atomic level. For now, technology
that modifies the other organisms in our body such as essential gut bacteria is
very primitive. Putting physical differences aside. Anything can learned. In
other words, any goal associated with learning can be achieved. Learn music,
art, dance, and many other things. The hard part to learning is often motivation
and a lack of learning strategy.
